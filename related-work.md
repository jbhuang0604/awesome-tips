# Writing Related Work

I enjoy reading/writing the related work section of a paper. It helps organize prior research and put the contributions of the work in proper context. 

But HOW? Check the thread!

## Divide and conquer

No one likes to read 1-2 pages full of texts. Identify a couple of important “topics” relevant to your research. Add paragraph titles (`\paragraph{}`) so that it’s easy to navigate.

## Topic

For each topic, write about 
1) the TRAJECTORY of the research progress as a story and 
2) the RELATIONSHIP of prior art and this paper.

## Trajectory

Describe what the problem is, why is it challenging, and what people have done in this field to tackle the problem? Connect existing work into a clear research trajectory.

## Avoid laundry list

Organizing and writing a topic as a clear trajectory is not easy. So instead of learning what to write, it’s often helpful to learn what NOT to write.

No “authors A did blah blah. Author B did blah blah. Author C”. Focus on the work, not the people.

## Don’t use citations as nouns

Your sentences should still be complete and correct even if you remove all the parenthetical citations.

## Don’t just describe, RELATE it

In each topic, articulate the relationship between prior work and yours. Ex:

> Our work is similar as we also …
> Our work differs in …
> Unlike/in contrast to …, we …

## Identifying the key differences

Try finding ONE key contrastive concept to separate your work from others. Highlight them with `\emph`. Ex:

- Multiple -> Single
- Content-agnostic -> Content-aware
- Static -> Dynamic

## Be respectful

Do not trash prior work. The authors may likely be your reviewer…

## Be generous

Make sure that you cover all the important references. Giving people credits does not make your work less worthy.
