Writing emails to a stranger could be daunting, but it's a great way to build connections, explore opportunities, and even advance your career.

How do we write an effective cold email? 

Check out the thread below for some ideas.


## Contents

Your email should contain the following four elements. 

- Greeting: "Hello"
- Introduction: "My name is Inigo Montoya."
- Context/Connection: "You killed my father."
- Call for action: "Prepare to die."

## Greeting

Understand basic email etiquette. Do not use Miss / Mrs. particularly if you know the recipient has a PhD. Respect their expertise.

## Introduction

A simple one would work. My name is NAME. I am a POSITION from AFFILIATION. I am writing to WHAT DO YOU WANT

## Context
  
Provide SPECIFIC context, personal connection, background information in your email. Do your homework!

## Call for action
  
Spell out what you expect the recipient to do after reading the email. Make it ACTIONABLE (e.g., set up a short meeting, answer a question, or prepare to die).

## Consistent format
  
This pitfall is quite common in inquiry emails from prospective students. Ex:

"I am fascinated by your work <paper A> and <paper B>." where paper titles are of inconsistent font type/sizes. This almost surely indicates that you are sending massive emails.

## Your name
  
Make sure that you full name "in English" appears as the sender. Don't use your favorite anime character's name or some unmemorable ID (e.g., A90291053@school.edu).

## Make it clear and structured
  
Emails are not just plain texts. Make the main points stand out using bold/italic fonts. Itemize your talking points to make the email easier to read.

## Quality
  
For prospective students looking for advisors, remember that your email is a WRITING SAMPLE. If your email is not clear or has lots of errors, it could actually hurt your case. Revise the emails before you send them.
